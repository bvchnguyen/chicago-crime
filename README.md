# About the Project

ChicagoCrime is a data mining initiative centered around the City of Chicago Crime Dataset. The dataset comprises crime records from 2001 to the present date and receives weekly updates. As of October 10, 2023, the dataset we are utilizing is current. You can access the dataset by clicking the badge above, and for a deeper understanding of our project, please refer to our [project proposal](./Project_Proposal.pdf).

# Technologies / Tools
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Scipy

# Goals

Our primary goal is to uncover correlations between various factors such as race, age, location, socioeconomic class, and criminal activities by using various data mining and machine learning methods. We also aim to understand how the type of crime may correlate to those attributes. Furthermore, our goal is to predict the type of crime based on the location, age, and time of occurrence. Goals will likely expand once our data is preprocessed and cleaned, in which we have a better understanding of the data.

# Assumptions
- We assume that the date attribute in the dataset is the date of crime occurrence, and not the date of the entry of said crime. This is because the date of entry is not relevant to the crime itself, and would not be useful in our analysis.

Bach Nguyen, Matthew Mayer, Samyak Ghimire, Suyogya Poudel

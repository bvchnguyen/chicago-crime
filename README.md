# chicago-crime
A data mining project on the City of Chicago Crime Dataset
[![ChicagoCrime](./resources/CHICAGO-CRIME-Dataset-.svg](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)


# Collaborators
Bach Nguyen, Matthew Mayer, Samyak Ghimire, Suyogya Poudel

# Project Description

# Assumptions
- We assume that the date attribute in the dataset is the date of crime occurrence, and not the date of the entry of said crime. This is because the date of entry is not relevant to the crime itself, and would not be useful in our analysis.
